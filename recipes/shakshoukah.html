            Shakshoukah is a Maghrebi dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, 
            onion and garlic, commonly spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper. 
            According to Joan Nathan, shakshouka originated in Ottoman North Africa in the mid-16th century 
            after tomatoes were introduced to the region by Hernan Cort√©s as part of the Columbian exchange.
