            Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based 
            dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as various types of
             sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked
              at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
